# Polymorphism

## Interface
+ In Go, the use of simple, often single-method interfaces that serve as clean, understandable boundaries between components is encouraged.
+ Good practices dictates that the interface name should be the method name with the er suffix.
+ In other programming languages, interfaces must be explicitly indicated through the word `implement`, in Go this is not the case.
